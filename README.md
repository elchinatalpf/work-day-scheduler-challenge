# Work Day Scheduler Project
![](./Assets/ScreenShot%20Work%20Day%20Scheduler.png)

This project is designed to help you organize your day. It uses a provided starter code, and all its functionality is contained within a single jQuery function. Additionally, it utilizes the Dayjs library to display the current time and marks each hour with a corresponding color: red for the current hour, grey for the past hours, and green for the future hour. Furthermore, it saves the user's input in local storage, allowing the data to persist even after reloading the page.

## Tasks Achieved
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
